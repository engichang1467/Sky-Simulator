# Sky Simulator
*"The sky's the limit"*

- Develop a Sky simulator that allows user to experience what is it like to be in the sky
- Like VR environment, it allows user to look around the sky without moving

## How I built it
- I built it with C++ and OpenGL

## Check it out
Make the files
```bash
$ make
```

Get the output
```bash
$ ./sky
```

- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left and right) to move around the environment, and esc key to escape
- Use up key to look down, and down key to move up
